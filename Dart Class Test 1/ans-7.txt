Method Overriding : When a child class tries to override the parent classâ€™s method that is called method overriding.

Rules for Method Overriding
1.The method which we want to override can only be written in the subclass, not in the same class.
2.The return type should be the same as in the method present in the superclass.
3.The argument list should be the same as in the method present in the superclass.
4.We cannot override a method if it is declared static or final.
5.If we can't inherit a method, we can't override it.

Example-

class ParentClass {
   void displayName(){
      print("Inside the Parent class Method");
   }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
@override
   void displayName(){
      print("Inside the Child class Method");
   }
}

void main(){
   ParentClass pClassObject = new ParentClass();
   ChildClass cClassObject = new ChildClass();
   pClassObject.displayName();
   cClassObject.displayName();
}

In this code the displayName() method is overridden
