Some major reasons for using dart in Flutter is given below -

1.Dart has a declarative and programmable layout that is easy to read and visualize. Hence, Flutter doesn’t require a separate declarative layout language like XML.

2.Dart provides a standalone VM that makes use of the language itself as its intermediate language 

3.One of Flutter’s main value propositions is that it saves engineering resources by letting developers create apps for both iOS and Android with the same codebase.

4.Flutter developers need a language that both delivers high performance and predictable performance, without periodic pauses that would cause dropped frames.
